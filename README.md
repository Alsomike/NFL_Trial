# This project was practice to get used to using the beautiful soup library to download and pull information from a website using HTML selectors. 
# the informatino is found and a printable table is created in the python terminal with AFC teams their wins and their losses. 
# eventual goal is to add these data to an excel sheet. 

# I am practicing version control with this repository as well.
